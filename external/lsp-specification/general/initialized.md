#### <a href="#initialized" name="initialized" class="anchor">Initialized Notification (:arrow_right:)</a>

The initialized notification is sent from the client to the server after the client received the result of the `initialize` request but before the client is sending any other request or notification to the server. The server can use the `initialized` notification for example to dynamically register capabilities. The `initialized` notification may only be sent once.

_Notification_:
* method: 'initialized'
* params: `InitializedParams` defined as follows:

```typescript
interface InitializedParams {
}
```
