#### <a href="#logTrace" name="logTrace" class="anchor">LogTrace Notification (:arrow_left:)</a>

A notification to log the trace of the server's execution.
The amount and content of these notifications depends on the current `trace` configuration.
If `trace` is `'off'`, the server should not send any `logTrace` notification.
If `trace` is `'messages'`, the server should not add the `'verbose'` field in the `LogTraceParams`.

`$/logTrace` should be used for systematic trace reporting. For single debugging messages, the server should send [`window/logMessage`](#window_logMessage) notifications.


_Notification_:
* method: '$/logTrace'
* params: `LogTraceParams` defined as follows:

```typescript
interface LogTraceParams {
	/**
	 * The message to be logged.
	 */
	message: string;
	/**
	 * Additional information that can be computed if the `trace` configuration
	 * is set to `'verbose'`
	 */
	verbose?: string;
}
```
