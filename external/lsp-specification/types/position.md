#### <a href="#position" name="position" class="anchor"> Position </a>

Position in a text document expressed as zero-based line and zero-based character offset. A position is between two characters like an 'insert' cursor in an editor. Special values like for example `-1` to denote the end of a line are not supported.

```typescript
interface Position {
	/**
	 * Line position in a document (zero-based).
	 */
	line: uinteger;

	/**
	 * Character offset on a line in a document (zero-based). The meaning of this
	 * offset is determined by the negotiated `PositionEncodingKind`.
	 *
	 * If the character value is greater than the line length it defaults back
	 * to the line length.
	 */
	character: uinteger;
}
```

When describing positions the protocol needs to specify how offsets (specifically character offsets) should be interpreted.
The corresponding `PositionEncodingKind` is negotiated between the client and the server during initialization.

<div class="anchorHolder"><a href="#positionEncodingKind" name="positionEncodingKind" class="linkableAnchor"></a></div>


```typescript
/**
 * A type indicating how positions are encoded,
 * specifically what column offsets mean.
 *
 * @since 3.17.0
 */
export type PositionEncodingKind = string;

/**
 * A set of predefined position encoding kinds.
 *
 * @since 3.17.0
 */
export namespace PositionEncodingKind {

	/**
	 * Character offsets count UTF-8 code units (e.g bytes).
	 */
	export const UTF8: PositionEncodingKind = 'utf-8';

	/**
	 * Character offsets count UTF-16 code units.
	 *
	 * This is the default and must always be supported
	 * by servers
	 */
	export const UTF16: PositionEncodingKind = 'utf-16';

	/**
	 * Character offsets count UTF-32 code units.
	 *
	 * Implementation note: these are the same as Unicode code points,
	 * so this `PositionEncodingKind` may also be used for an
	 * encoding-agnostic representation of character offsets.
	 */
	export const UTF32: PositionEncodingKind = 'utf-32';
}
```
