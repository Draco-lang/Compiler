	 * Used as the underlined span for mouse interaction. Defaults to the word

	 */
	originSelectionRange?: Range;

	/**
	 * The target resource identifier of this link.
	 */
	targetUri: DocumentUri;

	/**
	 * The full target range of this link. If the target for example is a symbol
	 * then target range is the range enclosing this symbol not including
	 * leading/trailing whitespace but everything else like comments. This
	 * information is typically used to highlight the range in the editor.
	 */
	targetRange: Range;

	/**
	 * The range that should be selected and revealed when this link is being
	 * followed, e.g the name of a function. Must be contained by the
	 * `targetRange`. See also `DocumentSymbol#range`
