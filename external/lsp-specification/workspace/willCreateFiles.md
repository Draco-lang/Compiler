#### <a href="#workspace_willCreateFiles" name="workspace_willCreateFiles" class="anchor">WillCreateFiles Request (:leftwards_arrow_with_hook:)</a>

The will create files request is sent from the client to the server before files are actually created as long as the creation is triggered from within the client either by a user action or by applying a workspace edit. The request can return a `WorkspaceEdit` which will be applied to workspace before the files are created. Hence the `WorkspaceEdit` can not manipulate the content of the files to be created. Please note that clients might drop results if computing the edit took too long or if a server constantly fails on this request. This is done to keep creates fast and reliable.

_Client Capability_:
* property name (optional): `workspace.fileOperations.willCreate`
* property type: `boolean`

The capability indicates that the client supports sending `workspace/willCreateFiles` requests.

_Server Capability_:
* property name (optional): `workspace.fileOperations.willCreate`
* property type: `FileOperationRegistrationOptions` where `FileOperationRegistrationOptions` is defined as follows:

	 * - `{}` to group sub patterns into an OR expression. (e.g. `**​/*.{ts,js}`

	 * - `[!...]` to negate a range of characters to match in a path segment

The capability indicates that the server is interested in receiving `workspace/willCreateFiles` requests.

_Registration Options_: none

* params: `CreateFilesParams` defined as follows:

<div class="anchorHolder"><a href="#createFilesParams" name="createFilesParams" class="linkableAnchor"></a></div>

```typescript
/**
 * The parameters sent in notifications/requests for user-initiated creation

 *
 * @since 3.16.0
 */
export interface CreateFilesParams {

	/**
	 * An array of all files/folders created in this operation.
	 */
	files: FileCreate[];
}
```

<div class="anchorHolder"><a href="#fileCreate" name="fileCreate" class="linkableAnchor"></a></div>

```typescript
/**
 * Represents information on a file/folder create.
 *
 * @since 3.16.0
 */
export interface FileCreate {

	/**
	 * A file:// URI for the location of the file/folder being created.
	 */
	uri: string;
}
```

_Response_:
* result:`WorkspaceEdit` \| `null`
* error: code and message set in case an exception happens during the `willCreateFiles` request.
