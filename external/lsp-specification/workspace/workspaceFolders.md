#### <a href="#workspace_workspaceFolders" name="workspace_workspaceFolders" class="anchor">Workspace folders request (:arrow_right_hook:)</a>

> *Since version 3.6.0*

Many tools support more than one root folder per workspace. Examples for this are VS Code's multi-root support, Atom's project folder support or Sublime's project support. If a client workspace consists of multiple roots then a server typically needs to know about this. The protocol up to now assumes one root folder which is announced to the server by the `rootUri` property of the `InitializeParams`. If the client supports workspace folders and announces them via the corresponding `workspaceFolders` client capability, the `InitializeParams` contain an additional property `workspaceFolders` with the configured workspace folders when the server starts.

The `workspace/workspaceFolders` request is sent from the server to the client to fetch the current open list of workspace folders. Returns `null` in the response if only a single file is open in the tool. Returns an empty array if a workspace is open but no folders are configured.

_Client Capability_:
* property path (optional): `workspace.workspaceFolders`
* property type: `boolean`

_Server Capability_:
* property path (optional): `workspace.workspaceFolders`
* property type: `WorkspaceFoldersServerCapabilities` defined as follows:

<div class="anchorHolder"><a href="#workspaceFoldersServerCapabilities" name="workspaceFoldersServerCapabilities" class="linkableAnchor"></a></div>

```typescript
export interface WorkspaceFoldersServerCapabilities {
	/**
	 * The server has support for workspace folders
	 */
	supported?: boolean;

	/**
	 * Whether the server wants to receive workspace folder
	 * change notifications.
	 *
	 * If a string is provided, the string is treated as an ID
	 * under which the notification is registered on the client
	 * side. The ID can be used to unregister for these events
	 * using the `client/unregisterCapability` request.
	 */
	changeNotifications?: string | boolean;
}
```

_Request_:
* method: `workspace/workspaceFolders`
* params: none

_Response_:
* result: `WorkspaceFolder[] | null` defined as follows:

<div class="anchorHolder"><a href="#workspaceFolder" name="workspaceFolder" class="linkableAnchor"></a></div>

```typescript
export interface WorkspaceFolder {
	/**
	 * The associated URI for this workspace folder.
	 */
	uri: URI;

	/**
	 * The name of the workspace folder. Used to refer to this
	 * workspace folder in the user interface.
	 */
	name: string;
}
```
* error: code and message set in case an exception happens during the 'workspace/workspaceFolders' request
