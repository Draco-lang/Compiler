#### <a href="#range" name="range" class="anchor"> Range </a>

A range in a text document expressed as (zero-based) start and end positions. A range is comparable to a selection in an editor. Therefore the end position is exclusive. If you want to specify a range that contains a line including the line ending character(s) then use an end position denoting the start of the next line. For example:
```typescript
{
    start: { line: 5, character: 23 },
    end : { line: 6, character: 0 }
}
```

```typescript
interface Range {
	/**
	 * The range's start position.
	 */
	start: Position;

	/**
	 * The range's end position.
	 */
	end: Position;
}
```
