#### <a href="#command" name="command" class="anchor"> Command </a>

Represents a reference to a command. Provides a title which will be used to represent a command in the UI. Commands are identified by a string identifier. The recommended way to handle commands is to implement their execution on the server side if the client and server provides the corresponding capabilities. Alternatively the tool extension code could handle the command. The protocol currently doesn't specify a set of well-known commands.

```typescript
interface Command {
	/**
	 * Title of the command, like `save`.
	 */
	title: string;
	/**
	 * The identifier of the actual command handler.
	 */
	command: string;
	/**
	 * Arguments that the command handler should be
	 * invoked with.
	 */
	arguments?: LSPAny[];
}
```
