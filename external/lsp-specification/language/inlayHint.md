#### <a href="#inlayHint_resolve" name="inlayHint_resolve" class="anchor">Inlay Hint Resolve Request (:leftwards_arrow_with_hook:)</a>

> *Since version 3.17.0*

The request is sent from the client to the server to resolve additional information for a given inlay hint. This is usually used to compute
the `tooltip`, `location` or `command` properties of an inlay hint's label part to avoid its unnecessary computation during the `textDocument/inlayHint` request.

Consider the clients announces the `label.location` property as a property that can be resolved lazy using the client capability

```typescript
textDocument.inlayHint.resolveSupport = { properties: ['label.location'] };
```

then an inlay hint with a label part without a location needs to be resolved using the `inlayHint/resolve` request before it can be used.

_Client Capability_:
* property name (optional): `textDocument.inlayHint.resolveSupport`
* property type: `{ properties: string[]; }`

_Request_:
* method: `inlayHint/resolve`
* params: `InlayHint`

_Response_:
* result: `InlayHint`
* error: code and message set in case an exception happens during the completion resolve request.

#### <a href="#workspace_inlayHint_refresh" name="workspace_inlayHint_refresh" class="anchor">Inlay Hint Refresh Request  (:arrow_right_hook:)</a>

> *Since version 3.17.0*

The `workspace/inlayHint/refresh` request is sent from the server to the client. Servers can use it to ask clients to refresh the inlay hints currently shown in editors. As a result the client should ask the server to recompute the inlay hints for these editors. This is useful if a server detects a configuration change which requires a re-calculation of all inlay hints. Note that the client still has the freedom to delay the re-calculation of the inlay hints if for example an editor is currently not visible.

_Client Capability_:

* property name (optional): `workspace.inlayHint`
* property type: `InlayHintWorkspaceClientCapabilities` defined as follows:

<div class="anchorHolder"><a href="#inlayHintWorkspaceClientCapabilities" name="inlayHintWorkspaceClientCapabilities" class="linkableAnchor"></a></div>

```typescript
/**
 * Client workspace capabilities specific to inlay hints.
 *
 * @since 3.17.0
 */
export interface InlayHintWorkspaceClientCapabilities {
	/**
	 * Whether the client implementation supports a refresh request sent from
	 * the server to the client.
	 *
	 * Note that this event is global and will force the client to refresh all
	 * inlay hints currently shown. It should be used with absolute care and
	 * is useful for situation where a server for example detects a project wide
	 * change that requires such a calculation.
	 */
	refreshSupport?: boolean;
}
```

_Request_:
* method: `workspace/inlayHint/refresh`
* params: none

_Response_:

* result: void
* error: code and message set in case an exception happens during the 'workspace/inlayHint/refresh' request
